Should I use Builder(97) for building the parse tree or
grammar? They use Builder(97) and Visitor(331) in the
scanner/parser described in the Facade(185) pattern.

    - Rather than Interpreter(243)?
	-- Would the Director be Lexer?
	-- Would the Builder be Node?
	-- Would a ConcreteBuilder be NodeRoot?
        -- No, because the parser should call the lexer.
    - Rather than Visitor(331)?
	-- Would the Director be Grammar?
	-- Would the Builder be NodeVisitor?
	-- Would a ConcreteBuilder be NodeToGrammarVisitor?
        -- No, because the "input stream" is heterogeneous.
